Comparatives are structurally complex in that they interact with other linguistic phenomena such as quantifiers, numerals, and lexical antonyms. In formal semantics, there is a rich body of work on comparatives and gradable expressions using the notion of degree. However, a logical inference system for comparatives has not been sufficiently developed for use in the NLI task. In this paper, we present a compositional semantics that maps various comparative constructions in English to semantic representations via Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) parsers and combine it with an inference system based on automated theorem proving. We evaluate our system on three NLI datasets that contain complex logical inferences with comparatives, generalized quantifiers, and numerals. We show that the system outperforms previous logic-based systems as well as recent deep learning-based models.","authors":["Izumi Haruta","Koji Mineshima","Daisuke Bekki"],"demo_url":"","keywords":["Logical Inferences","Comparative constructions","NLI task","automated proving"],"paper_type":"SRW","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-srw.35.pdf","sessions":[{"end_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 13:00:00 GMT","session_name":"8A","start_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 12:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""},{"end_time":"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 14:00:00 GMT","session_name":"13B","start_time":"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 13:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""}],"share_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-srw.35","similar_paper_uids":["srw.135","main.768","main.774","main.479","main.543"],"title":"Logical Inferences with Comparatives and Generalized Quantifiers","tldr":"Comparative constructions pose a challenge in Natural Language Inference (NLI), which is the task of determining whether a text entails a hypothesis.

Most methods proposed for this task rely on labeled or paired corpora (containing pairs of verbose and compressed sentences), which is often expensive to collect. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel unsupervised deep learning framework (SCAR) for deletion-based sentence compression. SCAR is primarily composed of two encoder-decoder pairs: a compressor and a reconstructor. The compressor masks the input, and the reconstructor tries to regenerate it. The model is entirely trained on unlabeled data and does not require additional inputs such as explicit syntactic information or optimal compression length. SCAR\u2019s merit lies in the novel Linkage Loss function, which correlates the compressor and its effect on reconstruction, guiding it to drop inferable tokens. SCAR achieves higher ROUGE scores on benchmark datasets than the existing state-of-the-art methods and baselines. We also conduct a user study to demonstrate the application of our model as a text highlighting system.

Our evaluations show that our method outperforms previous work based on supervised learning and transfer learning approaches for English. We demonstrate the utility of our method as an essential first step in developing augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices for patients suffering from aphasia in any language.","authors":["Sharan Pai","Nikhil Sachdeva","Prince Sachdeva","Rajiv Ratn Shah"],"demo_url":"","keywords":["Unsupervised Classification","speech disorder","naming detection","treatment"],"paper_type":"SRW","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-srw.3.pdf","sessions":[{"end_time":"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 06:00:00 GMT","session_name":"1A","start_time":"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 05:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""},{"end_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 09:00:00 GMT","session_name":"7A","start_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 08:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""}],"share_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-srw.3","similar_paper_uids":["srw.19","main.28","main.274","main.696","main.654"],"title":"Unsupervised Paraphasia Classification in Aphasic Speech","tldr":"Aphasia is a speech and language disorder which results from brain damage, often characterized by word retrieval deficit (anomia) resulting in naming errors (paraphasia).Automatic paraphasia detection has many benefits for both treatment and diagnosi...","track":"Student Research Workshop"},"forum":"srw.19","id":"srw.19","presentation_id":"38928640"},{"card_image_alt_text":"A representative figure from paper srw.114","card_image_path":"https://acl2020-public.s3.amazonaws.com/papers/srw.114.png","content":{"abstract":"The principle of compositionality has deep roots in linguistics: the meaning of an expression is determined by its structure and the meanings of its constituents.

However, abundant parallel data are hard to come by, especially for languages with a low number of speakers. When rich morphology exacerbates the data sparsity problem, it is imperative to have accurate alignment and filtering methods that can help make the most of what is available by maximising the number of correctly translated segments in a corpus and minimising noise by removing incorrect translations and segments containing extraneous data.This paper sets out a research plan for improving alignment and filtering methods for parallel texts in low-resource settings. We propose an effective unsupervised alignment method to tackle the alignment problem. Moreover, we propose a strategy to supplement state-of-the-art models with automatically extracted information using basic NLP tools to effectively handle rich morphology.","authors":["Stein\u00fe\u00f3r Steingr\u00edmsson","Hrafn Loftsson","Andy Way"],"demo_url":"","keywords":["Aligning Corpora","machine systems","data problem","alignment problem"],"paper_type":"SRW","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-srw.25.pdf","sessions":[{"end_time":"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 19:00:00 GMT","session_name":"4B","start_time":"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 18:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""},{"end_time":"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 22:00:00 GMT","session_name":"15B","start_time":"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 21:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""}],"share_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-srw.25","similar_paper_uids":["srw.106","main.756","main.417","main.578","srw.137"],"title":"Effectively Aligning and Filtering Parallel Corpora under Sparse Data Conditions","tldr":"Parallel corpora are key to developing good machine translation systems.

Most of the current state-of-the-art NLP results are achieved by using monolingual transformer models, where the model is pre-trained using a single language unlabelled text corpus. Then, the model is fine-tuned to the specific downstream task. However, the cost of pre-training a new transformer model is high for most languages. In this work, we propose a novel transfer learning method to adopt a strong source language model, trained from a large monolingual corpus to a low-resource language. Thus, using XLNet language model, we demonstrate competitive performance with mBERT and a pre-trained target language model on the Cross-lingual Sentiment (CLS) dataset and on a new sentiment analysis dataset for low-resourced language Tigrinya. With only 10k examples of the given Tigrinya sentiment analysis dataset, English XLNet has achieved 78.88% F1-Score outperforming BERT and mBERT by 10% and 7%, respectively. More interestingly, fine-tuning (English) XLNet model on the CLS dataset has promising results compared to mBERT and even outperformed mBERT for one dataset of the Japanese language.","authors":["Abrhalei Frezghi Tela","Abraham Woubie Zewoudie","Ville Hautam\u00e4ki"],"demo_url":"","keywords":["natural tasks","NLP","downstream task","pre-training"],"paper_type":"SRW","pdf_url":"","sessions":[{"end_time":"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 14:00:00 GMT","session_name":"3B","start_time":"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 13:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""},{"end_time":"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 10:00:00 GMT","session_name":"12B","start_time":"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 09:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""}],"share_url":"","similar_paper_uids":["srw.79","main.214","main.247","main.197","main.747"],"title":"Transferring Monolingual Model to Low-Resource Language: The Case of Tigrinya","tldr":"In recent years, transformer models have achieved great success in natural language processing tasks.

This pointwise-based evaluation method does not match well the objective of most real world applications, so the goal of our work is to understand how models which perform well under pointwise evaluation may fail in practice and find better methods for evaluating paraphrase identification models. As a first step towards that goal, we show that although the standard way of fine-tuning BERT for paraphrase identification by pairing two sentences as one sequence results in a model with state-of-the-art performance, that model may perform poorly on simple tasks like identifying pairs with two identical sentences. Moreover, we show that these models may even predict a pair of randomly-selected sentences with higher paraphrase score than a pair of identical ones.","authors":["Hannah Chen","Yangfeng Ji","David Evans"],"demo_url":"","keywords":["Pointwise Appraisal","binary problem","paraphrase identification","paraphrase models"],"paper_type":"SRW","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-srw.20.pdf","sessions":[{"end_time":"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 14:00:00 GMT","session_name":"3B","start_time":"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 13:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""},{"end_time":"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 19:00:00 GMT","session_name":"14B","start_time":"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 18:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""}],"share_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-srw.20","similar_paper_uids":["srw.84","main.535","main.545","main.28","main.445"],"title":"Pointwise Paraphrase Appraisal is Potentially Problematic","tldr":"The prevailing approach for training and evaluating paraphrase identification models is constructed as a binary classification problem: the model is given a pair of sentences, and is judged by how accurately it classifies pairs as either paraphrases ...","track":"Student Research Workshop"},"forum":"srw.84","id":"srw.84","presentation_id":"38928658"},{"card_image_alt_text":"A representative figure from paper srw.90","card_image_path":"https://acl2020-public.s3.amazonaws.com/papers/srw.90.png","content":{"abstract":"This paper describes the development of a verbal morphological parser for an under-resourced Papuan language, Nen.

A feature vector extracted from the image conveys visual information, but its ability to describe the image is limited. Other image captioning studies exhibited improved performance by exploiting feature differences, so the proposed model also utilizes them. First, we propose a difference and tag (DiTag) model containing the difference between the patient and normal images. Then, we propose a multi-difference and tag (mDiTag) model that also contains information about low-level differences, such as contrast, texture, and localized area.
