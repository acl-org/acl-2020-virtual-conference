In this paper, we investigate how to efficiently apply the pre-training language model BERT on the unsupervised domain adaptation. Due to the pre-training task and corpus, BERT is task-agnostic, which lacks domain awareness and can not distinguish the characteristic of source and target domain when transferring knowledge. To tackle these problems, we design a post-training procedure, which contains the target domain masked language model task and a novel domain-distinguish pre-training task. The post-training procedure will encourage BERT to be domain-aware and distill the domain-specific features in a self-supervised way. Based on this, we could then conduct the adversarial training to derive the enhanced domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments on Amazon dataset show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. The ablation study demonstrates that the remarkable improvement is not only from BERT but also from our method.","authors":["Chunning Du","Haifeng Sun","Jingyu Wang","Qi Qi","Jianxin Liao"],"demo_url":"","keywords":["Cross-Domain Analysis","Cross-domain classification","unsupervised adaptation","transferring knowledge"],"paper_type":"Long","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.370.pdf","sessions":[{"end_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 09:00:00 GMT","session_name":"7A","start_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 08:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""},{"end_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 13:00:00 GMT","session_name":"8A","start_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 12:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""}],"share_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.370","similar_paper_uids":["main.370","main.565","main.595","main.681","main.247"],"title":"Adversarial and Domain-Aware BERT for Cross-Domain Sentiment Analysis","tldr":"Cross-domain sentiment classification aims to address the lack of massive amounts of labeled data.

We thus study the question to what extent an argument's conclusion can be reconstructed from its premises. In particular, we argue here that a decisive step is to infer a conclusion's target, and we hypothesize that this target is related to the premises' targets. We develop two complementary target inference approaches: one ranks premise targets and selects the top-ranked target as the conclusion target, the other finds a new conclusion target in a learned embedding space using a triplet neural network. Our evaluation on corpora from two domains indicates that a hybrid of both approaches is best, outperforming several strong baselines.

It aims at extracting the potential pairs of emotions and their corresponding causes in a document. To solve this task, the existing research employed a two-step framework, which first extracts individual emotion set and cause set, and then pair the corresponding emotions and causes. However, such a pipeline of two steps contains some inherent flaws: 1) the modeling does not aim at extracting the final emotion-cause pair directly; 2) the errors from the first step will affect the performance of the second step. To address these shortcomings, in this paper we propose a new end-to-end approach, called ECPE-Two-Dimensional (ECPE-2D), to represent the emotion-cause pairs by a 2D representation scheme. A 2D transformer module and two variants, window-constrained and cross-road 2D transformers, are further proposed to model the interactions of different emotion-cause pairs. The 2D representation, interaction, and prediction are integrated into a joint framework. In addition to the advantages of joint modeling, the experimental results on the benchmark emotion cause corpus show that our approach improves the F1 score of the state-of-the-art from 61.28% to 68.89%.","authors":["Zixiang Ding","Rui Xia","Jianfei Yu"],"demo_url":"","keywords":["Prediction","emotion-cause extraction","text analysis","Joint Representation"],"paper_type":"Long","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.288.pdf","sessions":[{"end_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 06:00:00 GMT","session_name":"6A","start_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 05:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""},{"end_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 14:00:00 GMT","session_name":"8B","start_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 13:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""}],"share_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.288","similar_paper_uids":["main.288","main.289","main.342","main.372","main.52"],"title":"ECPE-2D: Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction based on Joint Two-Dimensional Representation, Interaction and Prediction","tldr":"In recent years, a new interesting task, called emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE), has emerged in the area of text emotion analysis.

This problem is challenging because differences in stance intensity are often subtle and require nuanced language understanding. Cyber argumentation research has shown that incorporating both stance polarity and intensity data in online debates leads to better discussion analysis. We explore five different learning models: Ridge-M regression, Ridge-S regression, SVR-RF-R, pkudblab-PIP, and T-PAN-PIP for predicting stance polarity and intensity in argumentation. These models are evaluated using a new dataset for stance polarity and intensity prediction collected using a cyber argumentation platform. The SVR-RF-R model performs best for prediction of stance polarity with an accuracy of 70.43% and intensity with RMSE of 0.596.

Specifically, a semantic-emotion heterogeneous graph is constructed from external semantic and emotion lexicons, which is then fed into a graph convolutional network to learn multi-hop semantic connections between words and emotion tags. Then, the learned semantic-emotion graph representation, which serves as prior knowledge bridging the gap between the source and target domains, is fully integrated into the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) stance classifier by adding a novel knowledge-aware memory unit to the BiLSTM cell.

Most recent efforts adopt attention-based neural network models to implicitly connect aspects with opinion words.

In this paper, we address this problem by means of effective encoding of syntax information. Firstly, we define a unified aspect-oriented dependency tree structure rooted at a target aspect by reshaping and pruning an ordinary dependency parse tree. Then, we propose a relational graph attention network (R-GAT) to encode the new tree structure for sentiment prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted on the SemEval 2014 and Twitter datasets, and the experimental results confirm that the connections between aspects and opinion words can be better established with our approach, and the performance of the graph attention network (GAT) is significantly improved as a consequence.","authors":["Kai Wang","Weizhou Shen","Yunyi Yang","Xiaojun Quan","Rui Wang"],"demo_url":"","keywords":["Aspect-based Analysis","encoding information","sentiment prediction","Relational Network"],"paper_type":"Long","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.295.pdf","sessions":[{"end_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 06:00:00 GMT","session_name":"6A","start_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 05:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""},{"end_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 13:00:00 GMT","session_name":"8A","start_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 12:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""}],"share_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.295","similar_paper_uids":["main.295","main.293","main.588","main.631","main.296"],"title":"Relational Graph Attention Network for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis","tldr":"Aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment polarity towards a specific aspect in online reviews.

With the shift from traditional news outlets to social media and similar venues, a major concern is that readers are becoming encapsulated in \"echo chambers\" and may fall prey to fake news and disinformation, lacking easy access to dissenting views. We suggest a novel task aiming to alleviate some of these concerns -- that of detecting articles that most effectively counter the arguments -- and not just the stance -- made in a given text. We study this problem in the context of debate speeches. Given such a speech, we aim to identify, from among a set of speeches on the same topic and with an opposing stance, the ones that directly counter it. We provide a large dataset of 3,685 such speeches (in English), annotated for this relation, which hopefully would be of general interest to the NLP community. We explore several algorithms addressing this task, and while some are successful, all fall short of expert human performance, suggesting room for further research.

In this paper, we formulate the data augmentation as a conditional generation task: generating a new sentence while preserving the original opinion targets and labels. We propose a masked sequence-to-sequence method for conditional augmentation of aspect term extraction. Unlike existing augmentation approaches, ours is controllable and allows to generate more diversified sentences.

In this work, we explicitly model label classes via label embeddings, and add mechanisms that track label-label correlations both during training and inference.

However, the interactive relations among three subtasks are still under-exploited. We argue that such relations encode collaborative signals between different subtasks. For example, when the opinion term is ``delicious'', the aspect term must be ``food'' rather than ``place''. In order to fully exploit these relations, we propose a Relation-Aware Collaborative Learning (RACL) framework which allows the subtasks to work coordinately via the multi-task learning and relation propagation mechanisms in a stacked multi-layer network.
