In this paper, we present the first computational study of parody. We introduce a new publicly available data set of tweets from real politicians and their corresponding parody accounts. We run a battery of supervised machine learning models for automatically detecting parody tweets with an emphasis on robustness by testing on tweets from accounts unseen in training, across different genders and across countries. Our results show that political parody tweets can be predicted with an accuracy up to 90%. Finally, we identify the markers of parody through a linguistic analysis. Beyond research in linguistics and political communication, accurately and automatically detecting parody is important to improving fact checking for journalists and analytics such as sentiment analysis through filtering out parodical utterances.","authors":["Antonios Maronikolakis","Danae S\u00e1nchez Villegas","Daniel Preotiuc-Pietro","Nikolaos Aletras"],"demo_url":"","keywords":["comedic purposes","computational parody","automatically tweets","fact checking"],"paper_type":"Long","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.403.pdf","sessions":[{"end_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 13:00:00 GMT","session_name":"8A","start_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 12:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""},{"end_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 19:00:00 GMT","session_name":"9B","start_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 18:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""}],"share_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.403","similar_paper_uids":["main.403","main.509","main.475","main.702","main.157"],"title":"Analyzing Political Parody in Social Media","tldr":"Parody is a figurative device used to imitate an entity for comedic or critical purposes and represents a widespread phenomenon in social media through many popular parody accounts.

The stock embedding is acquired with a deep learning framework using both news articles and price history. Because the embedding takes the operational form of a vector, it is applicable to other financial problems besides price prediction.

Though the model does not analyze their votes or political affiliations, the TBIP separates lawmakers by party, learns interpretable politicized topics, and infers ideal points close to the classical vote-based ideal points. One benefit of analyzing texts, as opposed to votes, is that the TBIP can estimate ideal points of anyone who authors political texts, including non-voting actors.

Our problem is framed as a natural language inference task with crowd-sourced preference votes by human players, obtained from a gamified voting platform. Along with the release of a new dataset of 200K data points, we benchmark several state-of-the-art neural models, along with BERT and friends on this task.

We build a new large-scale dataset, from multiple data sources, connecting state bills and legislator information, geographical information about their districts, and donations and donors' information. We suggest a novel task, predicting the legislative body's vote breakdown for a given bill, according to different criteria of interest, such as gender, rural-urban and ideological splits. Finally, we suggest a shared relational embedding model, representing the interactions between the text of the bill and the legislative context in which it is presented.

Prior studies have shown that some individuals can predict the outcome of future events with consistently better accuracy. This leads to a natural question: what makes some forecasters better than others? In this paper we explore connections between the language people use to describe their predictions and their forecasting skill. Datasets from two different forecasting domains are explored: (1) geopolitical forecasts from Good Judgment Open, an online prediction forum and (2) a corpus of company earnings forecasts made by financial analysts. We present a number of linguistic metrics which are computed over text associated with people's predictions about the future including: uncertainty, readability, and emotion. By studying linguistic factors associated with predictions, we are able to shed some light on the approach taken by skilled forecasters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to accurately predict forecasting skill using a model that is based solely on language.

Such choices are particularly salient in the consequential domain of crisis counseling, where a difficulty for counselors is balancing between two key objectives: advancing the conversation towards a resolution, and empathetically addressing the crisis situation. In this work, we develop an unsupervised methodology to quantify how counselors manage this balance. Our main intuition is that if an utterance can only receive a narrow range of appropriate replies, then its likely aim is to advance the conversation forwards, towards a target within that range. Likewise, an utterance that can only appropriately follow a narrow range of possible utterances is likely aimed backwards at addressing a specific situation within that range. By applying this intuition, we can map each utterance to a continuous orientation axis that captures the degree to which it is intended to direct the flow of the conversation forwards or backwards. This unsupervised method allows us to characterize counselor behaviors in a large dataset of crisis counseling conversations, where we show that known counseling strategies intuitively align with this axis. We also illustrate how our measure can be indicative of a conversation's progress, as well as its effectiveness.","authors":["Justine Zhang","Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil"],"demo_url":"","keywords":["Counseling Conversations","crisis counseling","unsupervised methodology","unsupervised method"],"paper_type":"Long","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.470.pdf","sessions":[{"end_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 19:00:00 GMT","session_name":"9B","start_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 18:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""},{"end_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 21:00:00 GMT","session_name":"10A","start_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 20:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""}],"share_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.470","similar_paper_uids":["main.470","main.184","main.635","main.568","main.183"],"title":"Balancing Objectives in Counseling Conversations: Advancing Forwards or Looking Backwards","tldr":"Throughout a conversation, participants make choices that can orient the flow of the interaction.

The present level of proliferation of fake, biased, and propagandistic content online has made it impossible to fact-check every single suspicious claim, either manually or automatically. Thus, it has been proposed to profile entire news outlets and to look for those that are likely to publish fake or biased content. This makes it possible to detect likely \u201cfake news\u201d the moment they are published, by simply checking the reliability of their source. From a practical perspective, political bias and factuality of reporting have a linguistic aspect but also a social context. Here, we study the impact of both, namely (i) what was written (i.e., what was published by the target medium, and how it describes itself in Twitter) vs. (ii) who reads it (i.e., analyzing the target medium\u2019s audience on social media). We further study (iii) what was written about the target medium (in Wikipedia). The evaluation results show that what was written matters most, and we further show that putting all information sources together yields huge improvements over the current state-of-the-art.","authors":["Ramy Baly","Georgi Karadzhov","Jisun An","Haewoon Kwak","Yoan Dinkov","Ahmed Ali","James Glass","Preslav Nakov"],"demo_url":"","keywords":["News Profiling","media profiling","Text Analysis","political bias"],"paper_type":"Long","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.308.pdf","sessions":[{"end_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT","session_name":"6B","start_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 06:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""},{"end_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 09:00:00 GMT","session_name":"7A","start_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 08:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""}],"share_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.308","similar_paper_uids":["main.308","main.332","main.404","srw.18","demo.35"],"title":"What Was Written vs. Who Read It: News Media Profiling Using Text Analysis and Social Media Context","tldr":"Predicting the political bias and the factuality of reporting of entire news outlets are critical elements of media profiling, which is an understudied but an increasingly important research direction.
