To support analysis for a wide variety of models, we introduce exBERT, a tool to help humans conduct flexible, interactive investigations and formulate hypotheses for the model-internal reasoning process. exBERT provides insights into the meaning of the contextual representations and attention by matching a human-specified input to similar contexts in large annotated datasets.

Although CodaLab has gained popularity in the research community, its interface has limited support for creating reusable tools that can be easily applied to new datasets and composed into pipelines. In clinical domain, natural language processing (NLP) on medical notes generally involves multiple steps, like tokenization, named entity recognition, etc. Since these steps require different tools which are usually scattered in different publications, it is not easy for researchers to use them to process their own datasets. In this paper, we present BENTO, a workflow management platform with a graphic user interface (GUI) that is built on top of CodaLab, to facilitate the process of building clinical NLP pipelines. BENTO comes with a number of clinical NLP tools that have been pre-trained using medical notes and expert annotations and can be readily used for various clinical NLP tasks. It also allows researchers and developers to create their custom tools (e.g., pre-trained NLP models) and use them in a controlled and reproducible way. In addition, the GUI interface enables researchers with limited computer background to compose tools into NLP pipelines and then apply the pipelines on their own datasets in a \"what you see is what you get'' (WYSIWYG) way. Although BENTO is designed for clinical NLP applications, the underlying architecture is flexible to be tailored to any other domains.","authors":["Yonghao Jin","Fei Li","Hong Yu"],"demo_url":"https://bio-nlp.org/bento/","keywords":["collaborative research","natural processing","NLP","named recognition"],"paper_type":"Demo","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-demos.13.pdf","sessions":[{"end_time":"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 18:45:00 GMT","session_name":"D4B-1","start_time":"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 17:45:00 GMT","zoom_link":""},{"end_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 18:45:00 GMT","session_name":"D4B-2","start_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 17:45:00 GMT","zoom_link":""}],"share_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-demos.13","similar_paper_uids":["demo.104","demo.31","demo.91","main.96","main.410"],"title":"BENTO: A Visual Platform for Building Clinical NLP Pipelines Based on CodaLab","tldr":"CodaLab is an open-source web-based platform for collaborative computational research.

Besides, we have developed an analysis tool and an interactive tool to assist researchers in diagnosing dialogue systems. The analysis tool presents rich statistics and summarizes common mistakes from simulated dialogues, which facilitates error analysis and system improvement. The interactive tool provides an user interface that allows developers to diagnose an assembled dialogue system by interacting with the system and modifying the output of each system component.","authors":["Qi Zhu","Zheng Zhang","Yan Fang","Xiang Li","Ryuichi Takanobu","Jinchao Li","Baolin Peng","Jianfeng Gao","Xiaoyan Zhu","Minlie Huang"],"demo_url":"https://github.com/thu-coai/ConvLab-2","keywords":["end-to-end evaluation","dialogue systems","error analysis","ConvLab-2"],"paper_type":"Demo","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-demos.19.pdf","sessions":[{"end_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 07:30:00 GMT","session_name":"D1C-2","start_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 06:30:00 GMT","zoom_link":""},{"end_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 13:00:00 GMT","session_name":"D3A-2","start_time":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 12:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""}],"share_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-demos.19","similar_paper_uids":["demo.49","main.54","tacl.1901","main.218","demo.102"],"title":"ConvLab-2: An Open-Source Toolkit for Building, Evaluating, and Diagnosing Dialogue Systems","tldr":"We present ConvLab-2, an open-source toolkit that enables researchers to build task-oriented dialogue systems with state-of-the-art models, perform an end-to-end evaluation, and diagnose the weakness of systems.

Consuming such a volume of news presents an almost insurmountable challenge. For example, a reader searching on Bloomberg's system for news about the U.K. would find 10,000 articles on a typical day. Apple Inc., the world's most journalistically covered company, garners around 1,800 news articles a day. We realized that a new kind of summarization engine was needed, one that would condense large volumes of news into short, easy to absorb points. The system would filter out noise and duplicates to identify and summarize key news about companies, countries or markets. When given a user query, Bloomberg's solution, Key News Themes (or NSTM), leverages state-of-the-art semantic clustering techniques and novel summarization methods to produce comprehensive, yet concise, digests to dramatically simplify the news consumption process. NSTM is available to hundreds of thousands of readers around the world and serves thousands of requests daily with sub-second latency. At ACL 2020, we will present a demo of NSTM.","authors":["Joshua Bambrick","Minjie Xu","Andy Almonte","Igor Malioutov","Guim Perarnau","Vittorio Selo","Iat Chong Chan"],"demo_url":"https://youtu.be/2he8Jgmjo9M","keywords":["Real-Time Composition","news process","NSTM","Bloomberg system"],"paper_type":"Demo","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-demos.40.pdf","sessions":[{"end_time":"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 13:45:00 GMT","session_name":"D3B-3","start_time":"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 12:45:00 GMT","zoom_link":""},{"end_time":"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 21:45:00 GMT","session_name":"D5B-3","start_time":"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 20:45:00 GMT","zoom_link":""}],"share_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-demos.40","similar_paper_uids":["demo.58","demo.100","main.331","main.478","main.77"],"title":"NSTM: Real-Time Query-Driven News Overview Composition at Bloomberg","tldr":"Millions of news articles from hundreds of thousands of sources around the globe appear in news aggregators every day.

However, their utility can be improved. These syntactic dependencies are designed to accurately reflect syntactic relations, and they do not make semantic relations explicit. Therefore, these representations lack many explicit connections between content words, that would be useful for downstream applications. Proposals like English Enhanced UD improve the situation by extending universal dependency trees with additional explicit arcs. However, they are not available to Python users, and are also limited in coverage. We introduce a broad-coverage, data-driven and linguistically sound set of transformations, that makes event-structure and many lexical relations explicit. We present pyBART, an easy-to-use open-source Python library for converting English UD trees either to Enhanced UD graphs or to our representation. The library can work as a standalone package or be integrated within a spaCy NLP pipeline. When evaluated in a pattern-based relation extraction scenario, our representation results in higher extraction scores than Enhanced UD, while requiring fewer patterns.","authors":["Aryeh Tiktinsky","Yoav Goldberg","Reut Tsarfaty"],"demo_url":"https://nlp.biu.ac.il/~aryeht/eud/","keywords":["IE","machine-learned tasks","downstream applications","data-driven transformations"],"paper_type":"Demo","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-demos.7.pdf","sessions":[{"end_time":"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 10:30:00 GMT","session_name":"D2C-1","start_time":"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 09:30:00 GMT","zoom_link":""},{"end_time":"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 21:00:00 GMT","session_name":"D5A-1","start_time":"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 20:00:00 GMT","zoom_link":""}],"share_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-demos.7","similar_paper_uids":["demo.59","main.375","main.746","main.303","main.96"],"title":"pyBART: Evidence-based Syntactic Transformations for IE","tldr":"Syntactic dependencies can be predicted with high accuracy, and are useful for both machine-learned and pattern-based information extraction tasks.

The idea is to gauge the quality of MT by its impact on the document translation approach to CLIR. As a case study, we run CLIReval on the \"metrics shared task\" of WMT2019; while this extrinsic metric is not intended to replace popular intrinsic metrics such as BLEU, results suggest CLIReval is competitive in many language pairs in terms of correlation to human judgments of quality.
