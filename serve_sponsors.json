We are particularly interested in algorithms that scale well and can be run efficiently in a\nhighly distributed environment.\n\nOur syntactic systems predict part-of-speech tags for each word in a given sentence, as well as morphological features\nsuch as gender and number. They also label relationships between words, such as subject, object, modification, and others.\nWe focus on efficient algorithms that leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, and recently have incorporated neural net technology.\n\nOn the semantic side, we identify entities in free text, label them with types (such as person, location, or organization),\ncluster mentions of those entities within and across documents (coreference resolution), and resolve the entities to\nthe Knowledge Graph.\n\nTo learn more about the research we\u2019re presenting at ACL 2020, please visit our [Google at ACL 2020 website](https://goo.gle/ACLhomepage).\n\nInterested in learning more about how we hire?

FAIR seeks to further our fundamental understanding in both new and existing domains, covering the full spectrum of topics related to AI, with the mission of advancing the state-of-the-art of AI through open research for the benefit of all. Facebook AI Applied Research engages in cutting-edge research that can improve and power new product experiences at huge scale for our community.\n\nFacebook AI is built on the key principles of openness, collaboration, excellence, and scale. We believe the latest advancements in AI should be published and open-sourced for the community. We work openly with internal and external partners to collaborate and share knowledge. We believe there is no shortage of new areas to explore in AI, and our researchers focus on the projects we believe will have the most positive impact on society. Finally, our research must account for both large scale data and computation needs in order to bring the benefits of AI to more people and improve accessibility. \n\nIf our mission and work intrigue you, Facebook AI is always looking to hire the best talent to our globally based teams.

DeepMind aims to build advanced AI to expand our knowledge and find solutions to thousands of problems.\n\nWe\u2019re a team of scientists, engineers, machine learning experts and more, working together to advance the state of the art in artificial intelligence. We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority.\n\nWe have a track record of breakthroughs in fundamental AI research, published in journals like Nature, Science, and more. Our programs have learned to diagnose eye diseases as effectively as the world\u2019s top doctors, to save 30% of the energy used to keep data centres cool, and to make state of the art predictions of the complex 3D shapes of proteins - which could one day transform how drugs are invented.\n\nDeepMind was founded in London in 2010, and we joined forces with Google in 2014 to accelerate our work. Since then, our community has expanded to include teams in Alberta, Montreal, Paris, and Mountain View in California.\n","downloads":[{"label":"Careers Leaflet - Engineering and Games","website":"static/pdf/DeepMind-Careers-EngGames.pdf"},{"label":"Careers Leaflet - Operations","website":"static/pdf/DeepMind-Careers-Ops.pdf"},{"label":"Careers Leaflet - Research","website":"static/pdf/DeepMind-Careers-Research.pdf"},{"label":"Careers Leaflet - Science and DeepMind for Google","website":"static/pdf/DeepMind-Careers-Science.pdf"},{"label":"Flyer - Language at ACL 2020","website":"static/pdf/DeepMind-Language-Flyer.pdf"},{"label":"Overview Deck - Language at ACL 2020","website":"static/pdf/DeepMind-Language-Deck.pdf"}],"duplicate":true,"logo":"static/images/sponsors/DeepMind-Final2020.png","name":"DeepMind","resources":[{"label":"Multi-agent Communication meets Natural Language: Synergies between Functional and Structural Language Learning\n","website":"static/pdf/Lazaridou-etal-2020.pdf"},{"label":"Do Transformers Need Deep Long-Range Memory?","website":"static/pdf/Rae-Razavi-2020.pdf"},{"label":"Learning to Segment Actions from Observation and Narration","website":"static/pdf/Fried-etal-2020.pdf"},{"label":"Better Document-Level Machine Translation with Bayes' Rule","website":"static/pdf/Yu-etal-2020.pdf"},{"label":"On the Cross-lingual Transferability of Monolingual Representations","website":"static/pdf/Artetxe-etal-2020.pdf"},{"label":"A Call for More Rigor in Unsupervised Cross-lingual Learning","website":"static/pdf/Artetxe-etal-2020b.pdf"}],"schedule":[{"duration":1,"label":"Chat with DeepMind Researchers","start":"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 15:00:00 GMT"},{"duration":1,"label":"Chat with DeepMind Researchers","start":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 15:00:00 GMT"},{"duration":1,"label":"Chat with DeepMind Researchers","start":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 18:00:00 GMT"},{"duration":1,"label":"Chat with DeepMind Researchers","start":"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 20:00:00 GMT"},{"duration":1,"label":"Chat with DeepMind Researchers","start":"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 04:00:00 GMT"},{"duration":1,"label":"Chat with DeepMind Researchers","start":"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 15:00:00 GMT"},{"duration":1,"label":"Chat with DeepMind Researchers","start":"Thu, 09 Jul 2020 10:00:00 GMT"},{"duration":1,"label":"Chat with DeepMind Researchers","start":"Thu, 09 Jul 2020 15:00:00 GMT"},{"duration":1,"label":"Chat with DeepMind Researchers","start":"Thu, 09 Jul 2020 20:00:00 GMT"},{"duration":1,"label":"Chat with DeepMind Researchers","start":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 18:00:00 GMT"}],"website":"https://deepmind.com","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/koEWIEHTopo","zoom_link":"https://zoom.us/j/93378401442"},{"UID":"17","channel":"sponsor-microsoft","contacts":[{"email":"Amy.Siebenthaler@microsoft.com","name":"University/PhD: Amy Siebenthaler\n"},{"email":"dgraney@microsoft.com","name":"Industry: Don Graney\n"}],"description":"Microsoft has over 50 papers accepted to ACL.
